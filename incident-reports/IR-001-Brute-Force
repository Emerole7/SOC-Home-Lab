# IR-001 — Brute Force Authentication Attempt

## Summary
Splunk detected multiple failed authentication attempts against a Windows Server account, consistent with brute-force activity.

## Environment
- Victim: Windows Server (RDP enabled)
- Attacker: Kali Linux (internal SOC-LAB network)
- SIEM: Splunk (Windows Security + Sysmon ingestion)

## Detection
- Alert: SOC - Brute Force Authentication Attempt
- Data: Windows Security Event ID 4625
- Trigger: >= 5 failures from same source IP within a short time window

## Key Evidence
- Splunk search results showing repeated 4625 events
- Triggered alert entry in Splunk
- Event Viewer 4625 detail showing source IP (Kali)

## Indicators
- Source IP: 192.168.2.6
- Target host: WIN-04KUH240MFE
- Target account: Administrator
- Time window: 02-05-2026/ 10:22:27 PST - 10:23:49 PST

## Impact Assessment
- No successful login confirmed (lab scenario)
- No persistence observed

## Response Actions (Lab)
- Validated alert logic and ingestion
- Confirmed log source and attacker IP in event details
- Recommended controls:
  - Account lockout policy
  - MFA for RDP access
  - Block offending IP at firewall
  - Restrict RDP exposure / use jump host

## Lessons Learned / Improvements
- Tune threshold to reduce false positives
- Add correlation for “4624 success after many 4625 fails”
- Enrich with Sysmon network events (Event ID 3)

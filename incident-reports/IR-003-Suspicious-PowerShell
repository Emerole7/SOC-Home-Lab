## Incident Summary
A scheduled Splunk alert triggered after detecting PowerShell process creation
with suspicious command-line arguments consistent with living off the land techniques.

## Detection Method
- SIEM: Splunk Enterprise
- Data Source: Sysmon EventCode 1
- Alert: SOC - Suspicious PowerShell Execution

## Timeline of Events

| Time | Event |
|-----|------|
| T0 | PowerShell executed with suspicious flags |
| T0 + minutes | Sysmon process creation event logged |
| T0 + minutes | Splunk alert triggered |

## Indicators
- Process: powershell.exe
- Suspicious Flags:
  - -NoProfile
  - -WindowStyle Hidden
- Host: Windows Server
- User Context: SYSTEM / Administrator (lab environment)

## Evidence
- Sysmon EventCode 1 showing PowerShell execution
- Splunk detection results
- Triggered alert confirmation

## Impact Assessment
In a production environment, this behavior may indicate:
- Script-based malware execution
- Credential harvesting
- Initial access or post-exploitation activity

No further malicious activity was observed in this lab scenario.

## Recommended Response Actions
1. Isolate affected endpoint
2. Review recent PowerShell execution history
3. Identify downloaded or modified files
4. Restrict PowerShell usage via policy if appropriate
5. Increase monitoring for persistence mechanisms

## Lessons Learned
- Sysmon filtering can impact detection visibility
- Raw log parsing ensures detection reliability
- Scheduled alerts provide stability for endpoint telemetry

## MITRE ATT&CK
- T1059.001 — Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell

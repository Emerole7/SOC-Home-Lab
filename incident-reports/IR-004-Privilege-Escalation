A Splunk alert triggered after detecting the addition of a newly created
local user account to the Administrators group on a Windows host.

## Detection Method
- SIEM: Splunk
- Alert: SOC - Local Administrator Added (Enriched)
- Data Source: Windows Security Logs (4720, 4732)

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|-----|------|
| T0 | Local user account created (4720) |
| T0 + minutes | User added to Administrators group (4732) |
| T0 + minutes | Splunk alert triggered |

## Evidence
- Event ID 4720 confirming account creation
- Event ID 4732 confirming admin group membership change
- SID-to-username enrichment identifying affected account


## Impact Assessment
In a production environment, this behavior could indicate:
- Backdoor administrative account creation
- Privilege escalation following initial compromise
- Insider threat activity

No further malicious activity was observed in this lab environment.

## Response Actions Taken
1. I verified the account and group membership change
2. I removed the unauthorized user from the Administrators group
3. I deleted the test account
4. I documented findings and detection logic

## MITRE ATT&CK

# Successful Logon After Multiple Failures (4624 after 4625)

## Description
Detects a potential compromise pattern where multiple failed logon attempts (4625) are followed by a successful logon (4624) from the same source IP within a defined time window.

## Data Source
- Windows Security Event Logs
- EventCode 4625 (Failed Logon)
- EventCode 4624 (Successful Logon)

## Splunk SPL (Correlation)
```spl
index=main sourcetype="wineventlog:security" (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624) earliest=-60m
| where Source_Network_Address!="-"
| eval outcome=case(EventCode=4625,"fail", EventCode=4624,"success")
| stats count(eval(outcome="fail")) as fails,
        count(eval(outcome="success")) as successes
  by Source_Network_Address
| where fails >= 5 AND successes >= 1

##Alert Settings
Scheduled: Every 1hour
Window: Last 60 minutes
Trigger: Per result (per source IP)
Throttle: 30 minutes recommended

##MITRE ATT&CK
T1110 — Brute Force (Credential Access)


##Analyst Triage Steps
Confirm source IP and target account(s)
Validate event order (failures → success)
Check for post login activity (process creation, PowerShell, Sysmon)
Containment recommendations: lock account, block IP, enforce MFA, restrict RDP

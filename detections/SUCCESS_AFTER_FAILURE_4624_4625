## Splunk SPL (Correlation)
```spl
index=main sourcetype="wineventlog:security" (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624) earliest=-60m
| where Source_Network_Address!="-"
| eval outcome=case(EventCode=4625,"fail", EventCode=4624,"success")
| stats count(eval(outcome="fail")) as fails,
        count(eval(outcome="success")) as successes
  by Source_Network_Address
| where fails >= 5 AND successes >= 1

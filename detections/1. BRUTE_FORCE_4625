Brute Force Authentication Attempt (Windows Event ID 4625)

##Goal
Detect repeated failed authentication attempts from a single source IP that may indicate possible brute-force activity.

## Data Source
- Windows Security Event Logs
- Event ID: 4625 (Failed Logon)

## Splunk Detection Query
> Triggers when failed logons from the same source IP reach a threshold (e.g., 5+) within a short time window.

## Splunk SPL
```spl
index=main sourcetype="wineventlog:security" EventCode=4625 earliest=-10m | where Source_Network_Address!="-" | stats count as failures by Source_Network_Address | where failures >= 5

## Alert Configuration
- Type: Real-time
- Trigger: Per result
- Threshold: >= 5 failures per source IP
- Action: Add to Triggered Alerts

## MITRE ATT&CK
- T1110 — Brute Force (Credential Access)

## SOC Triage Steps
1. Identify source IP and affected account(s)
2. Check for successful logons after failures (4624)
3. Confirm if source IP is internal or external (lab: Kali)
4. Recommend containment (block IP / disable account / enforce MFA)
